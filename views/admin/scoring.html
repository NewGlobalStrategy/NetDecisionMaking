<h1>Scoring maintenance</h1>
<p>Use this page to setup and amend the scoring table for the system.  Scoring points is not the key purpose of the system however it does we think add to the fun of things so it makes sense for this to be setup.  It is suggested that 10 levels is probably sufficient and any questions reaching higher levels will use the same scoring as the highest level defined. <p>
