  Some sort of system seems necessary to support large scale collective decision making.  Meeting functionality declines rapidly once a meeting exceeds about 20 participants and elections and surveys are also highly inefficient and unsatisfactory methods of decision making.  An alternative approach where consensus is required to resolve an issue and we then start working on other issues seems a far more efficient and fun approach.
We will have a lot of decisions to make in the years ahead and it seems rather unfair and probably irresponsible to burden our leaders with all these responsibilities.  If we all participate then we can feel involved and share in the challenge.

 Potentially this is very important.  Extending life expectancy and better sharing of resources has the potential to change billions of lives for the better.  There would be new obligations placed on those with power and wealth to participate and share in the fun, however they could be well rewarded for doing so and it should not require coercion to bring them on board.

        It will never be practical to hold a meeting of 7 billion people so we do need to look at alternative means to create some alignment on this planet.  Alignment behind a credible global strategy is currently sadly lacking and this could be viewed as somewhat embarrassing.

        No &shy; this differs from a survey tool in two key respects:
<ol><li>Questions are only asked until they appear to be resolved at which point we stop asking them unless a number of users challenge the answer.  This allows effort and discussion to be focussed on issues where there is disagreement.</li>
<li>This tool has real ambition to develop into an established system to run the planet.  Initial implementations will need to be on a smaller scale but the end objective is very clear.  Initially this would only be a support for existing methods of decision making however because it requires at least 3 independent people to be wrong before a mistake happens and because all decisions are open and not readily subject to influence or established elitism it is likely to make much better decisions than are achieved by existing methods.</li></ol>
